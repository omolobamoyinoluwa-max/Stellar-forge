StellarForge is a user-friendly decentralized application (dApp) that enables creators, entrepreneurs, and businesses in emerging markets to deploy custom tokens on the Stellar blockchain without writing a single line of code.

## Features

- **Token Factory Contract**: Deploy custom SEP-41 tokens on Stellar using a single Soroban smart contract, without writing or auditing your own contract code
- **Single & Batch Token Creation**: Deploy one token per transaction, or atomically deploy multiple tokens in a single `create_tokens_batch` call
- **Fee-Based System**: Configurable, admin-adjustable fees for token creation, metadata setting, and minting, paid in a dedicated SEP-41 fee token (typically native XLM)
- **Fee Splitting**: Route a percentage (in basis points) of every collected fee to multiple recipients instead of a single treasury address
- **Max Supply Caps**: Optionally cap a token's total mintable supply at creation time (batch path); further `mint_tokens` calls are rejected once the cap would be exceeded
- **IPFS Integration**: Store token metadata (images, descriptions) on IPFS via Pinata, referenced on-chain by a single `ipfs://` URI
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with the Freighter wallet extension for account discovery and transaction signing
- **Burn Functionality**: Token holders can burn their own balance; each token has a per-token `burn_enabled` flag an admin can toggle off
- **Admin Controls**: Update fees, pause/unpause the factory, rotate the admin address, and upgrade the contract's WASM in place
- **Network Mismatch Protection**: Writes are blocked in the UI whenever the connected Freighter network differs from the app's selected network, preventing accidental cross-network signing
- **Network Switcher**: Toggle between testnet and mainnet from the UI, each with its own contract ID, RPC endpoint, and explorer links
- **Transaction History**: View on-chain contract events (token creation, mint, burn, metadata, fee changes) with pagination and CSV export
- **Contract Upgradability**: In-place WASM upgrades with an idempotent, versioned state-migration path (`schema_version` + `migrate`) that preserves all existing tokens, fees, and admin state
- **Testnet & Mainnet Support**: The same frontend build supports both networks via environment configuration, with an explicit confirmation modal before mainnet-destructive actions

## How StellarForge Works

StellarForge is built around one on-chain "factory" contract that deploys and administers many independent token contracts, plus a React frontend that talks directly to Stellar — there is no StellarForge backend server and no database. Every piece of durable state (tokens, balances, fees, metadata pointers) lives on the Stellar ledger; the frontend is a thin, stateless client that reads and writes it.

### 1. The factory pattern

The `token-factory` Soroban contract (`contracts/token-factory/src/lib.rs`) is deployed once per network (one factory on testnet, one on mainnet). It does not implement token logic itself — instead it:

1. Holds a `token_wasm_hash`: the hash of a separately-deployed, audited SEP-41 token contract WASM.
2. On `create_token`, uses Soroban's deterministic deployer (`env.deployer().with_address(creator, salt)`) to instantiate a **new, independent contract instance** of that WASM, owned at an address derived from `(creator, salt)`.
3. Initializes the new token contract with the requested `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`, and optionally mints the caller an `initial_supply`.
4. Records bookkeeping for the new token in its own storage: a `TokenInfo` record (name, symbol, decimals, creator, timestamp, burn flag, optional max supply), a reverse `token_address → index` lookup, and an append-only `creator → [indices]` list for "my tokens" queries.

Every token deployed this way is a fully standalone contract on the ledger — it can be transferred, held, and queried through the standard SEP-41 interface by any Stellar wallet or tool, independent of StellarForge.

### 2. The fee model

Every mutating factory call that has a monetary cost (`create_token`, `create_tokens_batch`, `mint_tokens`, `set_metadata`) requires the caller to pass a `fee_payment` argument and pre-authorize a transfer of that amount in the factory's configured `fee_token` (a SEP-41 asset — usually native XLM). The factory:

- Rejects the call with `Error::InsufficientFee` if `fee_payment` is below the current `base_fee` (or `base_fee * token_count` for batch creation) or `metadata_fee`.
- Transfers the fee from the caller either straight to a single `treasury` address, or — if the admin has configured a **fee split** via `set_fee_split` — proportionally across multiple recipients by basis points (parts per 10,000), with any rounding remainder going to `treasury`.
- Lets the admin retune `base_fee` and `metadata_fee` at any time via `update_fees`, without redeploying.

### 3. Metadata: on-chain pointer, off-chain payload

Token images and descriptions are too large and mutable to store cheaply on a Soroban ledger, so StellarForge splits metadata into two layers:

1. **Off-chain payload** — the frontend uploads the image and a JSON document (`{ name, description, image }`) to IPFS through Pinata's pinning API, getting back a content identifier (CID) for each.
2. **On-chain pointer** — `set_metadata(token_address, admin, metadata_uri, fee_payment)` stores a single `ipfs://<cid>` string against the token, one time only (`Error::MetadataAlreadySet` on a second attempt). Any client — StellarForge's UI, a block explorer, another dApp — can resolve that URI through any IPFS gateway to fetch the same image/description.

### 4. Administration, safety, and lifecycle controls

- **Pause switch** — `pause`/`unpause` let the admin halt `create_token`, `create_tokens_batch`, `mint_tokens`, and `set_metadata` factory-wide in an emergency. `burn` intentionally ignores the pause flag, since token holders should always be able to reduce their own balance.
- **Reentrancy guard** — a `locked` flag on `FactoryState` prevents a second `create_token`/`create_tokens_batch` call from interleaving with one already in progress in the same transaction context.
- **Per-token burn toggle** — `set_burn_enabled` lets a token's creator disable burning for that token specifically (e.g. for a fixed-supply asset), independent of the factory-wide pause.
- **Allow-list primitives** — `add_to_whitelist` / `remove_from_whitelist` / `is_whitelisted` maintain an admin-managed address allow-list in factory storage. (These are currently standalone storage primitives; no factory entrypoint gates on them yet — see the project issue tracker for the tracked follow-up to wire enforcement into `create_token`.)
- **Admin rotation** — `transfer_admin` / `update_admin` move admin privileges to a new address (both perform the same underlying state change; `update_admin` additionally emits an `adm_upd` event).
- **Upgrade + migrate** — `upgrade` swaps the contract's executable WASM in place; `migrate` is an idempotent, versioned function (`schema_version` vs. `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`) that brings on-chain state up to date with the currently-deployed code without ever losing existing tokens or fee configuration. See [Contract Upgrade Process](#contract-upgrade-process) below.

### 5. The frontend's role

The React app (`frontend/src`) is organized in layers so that UI code never talks to the network directly:

- **`services/`** — the only layer that touches the outside world: `stellar.ts` / `stellar-impl.ts` build, sign-request, submit, and poll Soroban transactions and parse contract events; `ipfs.ts` uploads to and reads from Pinata; `wallet.ts` wraps the Freighter browser extension API.
- **`context/`** — app-wide React state: `WalletContext` (connected account, signing), `NetworkContext` (testnet/mainnet selection, persisted to `localStorage`, cross-checked against Freighter's actual network via `useNetworkMismatch`), `ToastContext`, `DarkModeContext`, `TosContext`.
- **`hooks/`** — data-fetching and derived state built on the services layer: `useTokens` (cached, paginated token listings), `useTransaction`/`useTransactionPolling` (submit-and-poll a signed transaction), `useFactoryState`, `useTokenBalance`, `useTransactionHistory`, and more.
- **`components/`** — presentation and forms (`CreateToken`, `MintForm`, `BurnForm`, `SetMetadataForm`, `AdminPanel`, `TokenExplorer`, `TokenDashboard`, `TransactionHistory`, …) that compose hooks and services but hold no blockchain logic of their own.

Because all state lives on-chain (or on IPFS), the frontend can be redeployed, pointed at a different factory contract ID, or replaced entirely without any data migration — it is purely a view over the Stellar ledger.

## Tech Stack

### Backend (Smart Contracts)

- **Rust**: Programming language for Soroban contracts
- **Soroban SDK**: Stellar's smart contract development framework
- **Soroban Token SDK**: For token operations

### Frontend

- **React 19**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vitest**: Testing framework

### Integrations

- **Freighter Wallet**: Stellar wallet browser extension
- **IPFS/Pinata**: Decentralized file storage for metadata
- **Stellar Horizon**: Blockchain data API
- **Soroban RPC**: Smart contract interaction

## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: For building Soroban contracts
- **Node.js** (v18+): For frontend development
- **Stellar CLI**: For contract deployment and testing (see setup below)
- **Freighter Wallet**: Browser extension for Stellar transactions

## Installation & Setup

You can set up StellarForge using either Docker (recommended for quick start) or local installation.

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites**: Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd stellar-forge

# Start development environment
docker compose up -d

# Frontend available at: http://localhost:5173
# Access contract builder: docker compose exec contract-builder bash
```

See [DOCKER_SETUP.md](DOCKER_SETUP.md) for detailed Docker instructions.

### Option 2: Local Installation

**Prerequisites**: Rust, Node.js (v18+), Stellar CLI, Freighter Wallet

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd stellar-forge
```

### 2. Setup Stellar CLI Environment

Run the setup script to install Rust, Stellar CLI, and configure testnet:

```bash
./scripts/setup-soroban.sh
```

> **Note:** The Soroban CLI was renamed to `stellar` in recent versions. All commands below use `stellar`. If you have the old `soroban` binary installed, uninstall it and run the setup script again:
>
> ```bash
> cargo uninstall soroban-cli
> cargo install stellar-cli --features opt
> ```

### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Copy the example env file and fill in your values:
Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

Then edit `frontend/.env`:

```env
VITE_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID=<deployed-contract-id>
```

Metadata uploads go through a serverless proxy (`api/ipfs/*`) so Pinata
credentials never reach the browser. Set these as **server-side** environment
variables in your Vercel project settings (or a local `.env` at the repo
root when running `vercel dev`) - never prefix them with `VITE_`, or they'll
be inlined into the client bundle and shipped to every visitor:

```env
PINATA_API_KEY=<pinata-api-key>
PINATA_API_SECRET=<pinata-api-secret>
```

> **Note:** `VITE_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID`, `VITE_IPFS_API_KEY`, and `VITE_IPFS_API_SECRET` are required. The app will display a misconfiguration screen if any of these are missing, rather than failing silently at runtime.

## Building & Testing

### Smart Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

For an optimized binary (requires `binaryen` — install via `apt install binaryen` or `brew install binaryen`):

```bash
cd contracts/token-factory
bash build.sh
```

This produces `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/token_factory.optimized.wasm`, which is significantly smaller and lowers on-chain deployment costs.

### Run Contract Tests

```bash
cd contracts/token-factory
cargo test
```

### Run Contract Fuzz Tests

Fuzz testing with random inputs discovers edge cases and potential crashes:

```bash
cd contracts/token-factory/fuzz
cargo fuzz run fuzz_create_token -- -timeout=60    # Test token creation
cargo fuzz run fuzz_fee_arithmetic -- -timeout=60  # Test fee calculations
cargo fuzz run fuzz_burn -- -timeout=60            # Test burn operations
```

For more details on fuzz testing setup and interpretation, see [contracts/token-factory/fuzz/README.md](contracts/token-factory/fuzz/README.md).

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Lint code
```

## Contract Functions

The authoritative, field-by-field reference — including parameter tables, every error code, and every emitted event — lives in [`docs/contract-abi.md`](./docs/contract-abi.md). This section is a quick-scan summary of the same `#[contractimpl]` surface in `contracts/token-factory/src/lib.rs`.

### Initialization

- `initialize(admin, treasury, fee_token, token_wasm_hash, base_fee, metadata_fee)`: One-time factory setup. Fails with `AlreadyInitialized` on retry.

### Token Lifecycle

- `create_token(creator, salt, name, symbol, decimals, initial_supply, fee_payment)`: Deploy a single new token contract at a deterministic `(creator, salt)` address; optionally mint `initial_supply` to `creator`.
- `create_tokens_batch(creator, tokens, fee_payment)`: Atomically deploy a `Vec<BatchTokenParams>` (each with its own name/symbol/decimals/initial_supply and optional `max_supply` cap) in one transaction. `fee_payment` must cover `base_fee * tokens.len()`; a failure partway through the batch aborts the whole call.
- `mint_tokens(token_address, admin, to, amount, fee_payment)`: Mint additional supply. Only the token's original creator may call this. Rejected with `MaxSupplyExceeded` if the token was created with a `max_supply` cap that minting would exceed.
- `burn(token_address, from, amount)`: Burn `amount` from the caller's own balance. Honors the token's `burn_enabled` flag; ignores the factory-wide pause.

### Metadata

- `set_metadata(token_address, admin, metadata_uri, fee_payment)`: Attach an `ipfs://` (or `https://`) metadata URI to a token. One-shot — a second call returns `MetadataAlreadySet`.
- `set_burn_enabled(token_address, admin, enabled)`: Toggle whether a specific token can be burned. Caller must be the token's creator.

### Admin & Governance

- `update_fees(admin, base_fee?, metadata_fee?)`: Adjust either fee; `None` leaves it unchanged.
- `set_fee_split(admin, splits)` / `get_fee_split()`: Configure or read a `Map<Address, u32>` of basis-point fee recipients (must sum to `10_000`, or be empty to clear the split and fall back to `treasury`).
- `pause(admin)` / `unpause(admin)`: Halt or resume `create_token`, `create_tokens_batch`, `mint_tokens`, and `set_metadata` factory-wide.
- `add_to_whitelist(admin, address)` / `remove_from_whitelist(admin, address)` / `is_whitelisted(address)`: Maintain an admin-managed address allow-list in contract storage (not currently enforced by any entrypoint — see the issue tracker).
- `transfer_admin(admin, new_admin)` / `update_admin(current_admin, new_admin)`: Rotate the admin address. Equivalent effect; `update_admin` additionally emits an `adm_upd` event.
- `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)`: Replace the factory's executable WASM in place, preserving all state. See [Contract Upgrade Process](#contract-upgrade-process).
- `migrate(admin)`: Idempotently bring on-chain state up to `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` after an upgrade.

### View Functions

- `get_state()`: Full `FactoryState` (admin, treasury, fee_token, fees, pause flag, token count, schema version).
- `get_base_fee()` / `get_metadata_fee()`: Current fee values.
- `get_token_info(index)`: Look up a token by its 1-based factory index.
- `get_tokens_by_creator(creator, offset, limit)`: Paginated slice of token indices created by a given address. The contract caps `limit` at `MAX_TOKENS_BY_CREATOR_PAGE` (currently 50) per call, so list iteration should advance `offset` by the previous page's length until a short page is returned. The frontend's `fetchAllTokensByCreator` helper (`frontend/src/hooks/useTokens.ts`) does this loop automatically.

### Errors

All fallible entrypoints return `Result<T, Error>`. See the full table (17 variants, e.g. `InsufficientFee`, `Unauthorized`, `ContractPaused`, `MaxSupplyExceeded`, `InvalidFeeSplit`) in [`docs/contract-abi.md`](./docs/contract-abi.md#errors).

### Events

The contract publishes Soroban events on `(factory, action)` topics — `init`, `created`, `meta`, `mint`, `burn`, `fees`, `pause`, `unpause`, `adm_upd` — parsed by the frontend in `frontend/src/services/stellar-impl.ts` and rendered in the Transaction History view. See [`docs/contract-abi.md`](./docs/contract-abi.md#events) for the exact payload of each.

## Usage

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use the Freighter browser extension to connect an account. The app checks that Freighter's active network matches the app's selected network and blocks writes on mismatch.
2. **Create Token**: Fill in name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply; the form validates against the same rules the contract enforces (name ≤ 32 chars, symbol ≤ 12 chars, decimals 0–18) before submission. Sign and submit the transaction to pay the creation fee and deploy the token contract.
3. **Set Metadata**: Upload a token image and description — the app uploads the image to IPFS, pins a metadata JSON document referencing it, then calls `set_metadata` with the resulting `ipfs://` URI (one-time only per token).
4. **Mint Tokens**: As the token's creator, mint additional supply to any address, subject to the token's optional `max_supply` cap.
5. **Manage Supply**: Token holders can burn their own balance at any time (unless the creator has disabled burning for that token via `set_burn_enabled`).
6. **Admin Panel**: The factory admin can update fees, configure a fee split, pause/unpause the factory, and rotate the admin address from the in-app Admin Panel.
7. **Explore & Export**: Browse all deployed tokens or a specific creator's tokens in the Token Explorer/Dashboard, and export transaction history to CSV.

## Deployment

## Deployment & Caching

The application uses a service worker (via Workbox) to support offline capabilities. The cache is versioned using the `VITE_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID` and `VITE_NETWORK` environment variables.

- When either of these variables changes, the service worker will be updated and old caches will be cleared automatically.
- The user interface displays the current contract ID and network in the footer, allowing manual verification before signing any transaction.

To force a cache refresh, users can either reload the page (the SW will update in the background) or clear the site data from the browser.

**Important**: After a contract redeployment, ensure the environment variables are updated and the build is deployed. The new SW will be served and clients will fetch the updated assets.

### Testnet Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying StellarForge to Stellar testnet from scratch.

#### Prerequisites

- Stellar CLI installed (run `./scripts/setup-soroban.sh` if not)
- Freighter wallet installed in your browser
- Basic understanding of command line

#### Step 1: Get Testnet XLM

You need testnet XLM to pay for contract deployment and transactions.

1. **Create a testnet account** using Stellar CLI:

   ```bash
   stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet
   ```

   This creates a new keypair and saves it locally. The output shows your public key.

2. **Fund your account** using Friendbot:

   ```bash
   stellar keys address deployer
   # Copy the address (starts with G...)

   # Fund with 10,000 testnet XLM
   curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE"
   ```

3. **Verify your balance**:
   ```bash
   stellar account balance deployer --network testnet
   ```
   You should see 10,000 XLM.

#### Step 2: Build the Contract

```bash
cd contracts/token-factory

# Build the contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Optimize the binary (reduces size and deployment costs)
stellar contract optimize \
  --wasm ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/token_factory.wasm
```

The optimized WASM will be at `../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/token_factory.optimized.wasm`.

#### Step 3: Deploy the Factory Contract

```bash
# Deploy to testnet
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/token_factory.optimized.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet

# Save the contract ID (starts with C...)
# Example output: CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

**Save this contract ID** - you'll need it for initialization and frontend configuration.

#### Step 4: Upload Token Contract WASM

The factory needs the token contract WASM hash to deploy tokens.

```bash
# First, build the standard Stellar token contract
# (or use your custom token implementation)
stellar contract install \
  --wasm path/to/soroban_token_contract.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet

# Save the WASM hash (64 hex characters)
# Example: 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

If you don't have a token WASM, you can use the Stellar Asset Contract:

```bash
# Download the official Stellar token contract
wget https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/raw/main/token/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_token_contract.wasm

# Install it
stellar contract install \
  --wasm soroban_token_contract.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

#### Step 5: Initialize the Factory

```bash
# Get your admin address (same as deployer for simplicity)
ADMIN_ADDRESS=$(stellar keys address deployer)

# Initialize the contract
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  initialize \
  --admin $ADMIN_ADDRESS \
  --treasury $ADMIN_ADDRESS \
  --fee_token <NATIVE_XLM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  --token_wasm_hash <TOKEN_WASM_HASH_FROM_STEP_4> \
  --base_fee 100000000 \
  --metadata_fee 50000000
```

**Parameters explained:**

- `admin`: Address that can update fees, pause the factory, manage the whitelist and fee split, rotate the admin, and upgrade the contract
- `treasury`: Default address that receives fees from token creation (overridden per-recipient if a fee split is configured)
- `fee_token`: Contract address for the SEP-41 token used to pay all fees (use native XLM contract: `CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC`)
- `token_wasm_hash`: The WASM hash uploaded in Step 4 — every token the factory deploys is an instance of this code
- `base_fee`: Fee for `create_token` / `mint_tokens` / each token in `create_tokens_batch` (in stroops, 1 XLM = 10,000,000 stroops)
- `metadata_fee`: Fee for `set_metadata`

#### Step 6: Configure Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your values
nano .env
```

Update these required variables:

```env
VITE_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID=<your-factory-contract-id>
VITE_TOKEN_WASM_HASH=<your-token-wasm-hash>
VITE_IPFS_API_KEY=<your-pinata-api-key>
VITE_IPFS_API_SECRET=<your-pinata-api-secret>
```

> **Keep `VITE_TOKEN_WASM_HASH` in sync with the factory.** This value must equal the
> factory's on-chain `token_wasm_hash` — the WASM the factory actually deploys tokens
> from. That field is set at `initialize` time and can only change through a contract
> upgrade + migrate, so the realistic way they drift apart is a factory upgrade that
> ships without a matching frontend redeploy.
>
> On startup (and every 5 minutes thereafter) the app reads `get_state()` and compares
> the on-chain hash against this variable, showing a red warning banner if they differ.
> Treat that banner as a deployment bug: it is a **safety net for detecting drift, not a
> substitute for updating both in lockstep**. If the check cannot be completed — the RPC
> read fails, or the variable is unset — the app stays silent rather than warning, so a
> missing banner is not by itself proof that the hashes match.

**Getting Pinata credentials:**

1. Sign up at [https://app.pinata.cloud](https://app.pinata.cloud)
2. Go to API Keys → New Key
3. Enable "pinFileToIPFS" permission
4. Copy the API Key and API Secret

#### Step 7: Test Locally

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
```

1. Connect your Freighter wallet (make sure it's on testnet)
2. Try creating a test token
3. Verify the transaction on [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet)

#### Step 8: Deploy Frontend

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy the dist/ folder to your hosting service
```

**Deployment options:**

- **Vercel**: See [docs/deployment-vercel.md](./docs/deployment-vercel.md)
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist/` folder
- **GitHub Pages**: Use `gh-pages` package
- **Your own server**: Serve the `dist/` folder with nginx/apache

### Mainnet Deployment

⚠️ **Warning**: Mainnet deployment involves real money. Test thoroughly on testnet first!

Before deploying to mainnet, complete the [Mainnet Deployment Checklist](./docs/mainnet-deployment-checklist.md).

The process is identical to testnet, but:

1. Use `--network mainnet` instead of `--network testnet`
2. Fund your account with real XLM (buy from an exchange)
3. Set `VITE_NETWORK=mainnet` in your `.env`
4. Review all parameters carefully before deployment
5. Consider using a hardware wallet for the admin key

### Troubleshooting Deployment

#### Error: "account not found"

Your account doesn't exist on the network yet. Fund it with Friendbot (testnet) or send XLM from an exchange (mainnet).

```bash
# Testnet
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=$(stellar keys address deployer)"
```

#### Error: "insufficient balance"

You don't have enough XLM to pay for the transaction.

```bash
# Check balance
stellar account balance deployer --network testnet

# Get more testnet XLM
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=$(stellar keys address deployer)"
```

#### Error: "contract already initialized"

The contract has already been initialized. You can't initialize it again. If you need to change parameters, deploy a new contract.

#### Error: "wasm not found"

The WASM hash you provided doesn't exist on the network. Make sure you ran `stellar contract install` first and used the correct hash.

#### Build fails with "target not found"

Add the wasm32 target to Rust:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

#### Frontend shows "Misconfiguration Screen"

One or more required environment variables are missing. Check that your `.env` file has:

- `VITE_FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID`
- `VITE_TOKEN_WASM_HASH`
- `VITE_IPFS_API_KEY`
- `VITE_IPFS_API_SECRET`

Restart the dev server after changing `.env` files.

### Component Interactions

1. **User → Frontend**: User interacts with React UI to create tokens, set metadata, etc.

2. **Frontend → Freighter**: Frontend uses Freighter API to request transaction signatures

3. **Frontend → Stellar Network**: Signed transactions are submitted to Stellar via Soroban RPC

4. **Factory Contract → Token Contracts**: Factory deploys new token contracts using the token WASM hash

5. **Frontend → IPFS**: Token metadata (images, descriptions) are uploaded to IPFS via Pinata

6. **Frontend → Stellar Network**: Metadata URIs (ipfs://...) are stored on-chain via `set_metadata`

### Data Flow Example: Creating a Token

```
1. User fills form → 2. Frontend validates → 3. Freighter signs tx

                                            5. Factory Contract
                                               - Validates params
                                               - Collects fee
                                               - Deploys token
                                                      ↓
                                            6. New Token Contract
                                               - Initialized

                                            8. Frontend updates UI
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Freighter Wallet Not Detected

**Symptoms**: "Wallet not installed" error or connection button doesn't work

**Solutions**:

- Install [Freighter wallet extension](https://www.freighter.app/)
- Refresh the page after installing
- Check that Freighter is enabled in your browser extensions
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge supported)

#### 2. Wrong Network Selected

**Symptoms**: Transactions fail with "account not found" or "contract not found"

**Solutions**:

- Check the network indicator in the top-right corner of the app
- Click the network switcher to toggle between testnet and mainnet
- In Freighter, ensure you're on the same network as the app
- Verify `VITE_NETWORK` in your `.env` matches your deployment

#### 3. Insufficient Balance / Fee Errors

**Symptoms**: "insufficient balance" or "insufficient fee" errors

**Solutions**:

- **Testnet**: Get free XLM from Friendbot:
  ```bash
  curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=YOUR_ADDRESS"
  ```
- **Mainnet**: Buy XLM from an exchange and send to your wallet
- Check your balance in Freighter wallet
- Ensure you have at least 2-3 XLM for contract interactions
- Fee errors may indicate the factory's fee requirements have increased

#### 4. Transaction Timeout

**Symptoms**: Transaction pending for a long time, then fails

**Solutions**:

- Check Stellar network status at [status.stellar.org](https://status.stellar.org)
- Increase timeout in the code (default is 30 seconds)
- Try submitting the transaction again
- Check if Soroban RPC endpoint is responding:
  ```bash
  curl https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org/health
  ```

#### 5. IPFS Upload Fails

**Symptoms**: "Failed to upload metadata" or IPFS errors

**Solutions**:

- Verify your Pinata API credentials in `.env`
- Check Pinata dashboard for API key status
- Ensure image file is under 10MB
- Try a different image format (PNG, JPG, GIF supported)
- Check Pinata service status at [status.pinata.cloud](https://status.pinata.cloud)

#### 6. Contract Initialization Fails

**Symptoms**: "AlreadyInitialized" error or initialization transaction fails

**Solutions**:

- Contract can only be initialized once
- If you need different parameters, deploy a new contract
- Check if contract is already initialized:
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke \
    --id <contract-id> \
    --network testnet \
    -- get_state
  ```

#### 7. Token Creation Fails

**Symptoms**: "InvalidTokenParams" or creation transaction fails

**Solutions**:

- Ensure token name is 1-32 characters
- Ensure token symbol is 1-12 characters
- Decimals must be 0-18
- Initial supply must be non-negative
- Check that you have enough XLM to pay the creation fee
- Verify the factory is not paused:
  ```bash
  stellar contract invoke \
    --id <contract-id> \
    --network testnet \
    -- get_state
  ```

#### 8. Metadata Not Displaying

**Symptoms**: Token created but image/description doesn't show

**Solutions**:

- Check that metadata was set (look for `metadata_set` event)
- Verify IPFS URI is accessible:
  ```bash
  curl https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/<your-cid>
  ```
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for CORS or loading errors
- Ensure metadata JSON follows the correct format:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Token Name",
    "description": "Token description",
    "image": "ipfs://..."
  }
  ```

#### 9. Build Errors

**Symptoms**: `cargo build` or `npm run build` fails

**Solutions**:

- **Rust build fails**:
  ```bash
  rustup update
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  cd contracts && cargo clean && cargo build
  ```
- **Frontend build fails**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- Check that you're using compatible versions (Node 18+, Rust stable)

#### 10. Events Not Loading

**Symptoms**: Transaction history or token events don't display

**Solutions**:

- Check that Soroban RPC endpoint supports `getEvents`
- Verify contract ID is correct in `.env`
- Check browser console for API errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Ensure you're on the correct network (testnet/mainnet)

## Security

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please review our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure guidelines.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

A strict CSP is defined as a `<meta>` tag in `frontend/index.html`:

```
default-src 'self';
connect-src 'self' https://*.stellar.org https://api.pinata.cloud;
img-src 'self' data: https://gateway.pinata.cloud;
script-src 'self'
```

For stronger enforcement, set the CSP as an HTTP response header on your hosting provider instead of (or in addition to) the meta tag — HTTP headers take precedence and support more directives like `frame-ancestors`.

**Vercel** — add to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
          "value": "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://*.stellar.org https://api.pinata.cloud; img-src 'self' data: https://gateway.pinata.cloud; script-src 'self'"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Netlify** — add to `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://*.stellar.org https://api.pinata.cloud; img-src 'self' data: https://gateway.pinata.cloud; script-src 'self'"
```

**Nginx** — add to your server block:

```nginx
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://*.stellar.org https://api.pinata.cloud; img-src 'self' data: https://gateway.pinata.cloud; script-src 'self'";
```

For users deploying tokens, we strongly recommend:

- Always test on testnet first before mainnet deployment
- Review all parameters carefully using the [Mainnet Deployment Checklist](./docs/mainnet-deployment-checklist.md)
- Verify contract addresses and transaction details before signing

## Fee Bump Transactions

If a user's XLM balance is too low to cover the network base fee, their transaction will fail. Stellar's [fee bump](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/transactions-specialized/fee-bump-transactions) mechanism lets a third-party account (the _fee source_) pay the base fee on behalf of the original sender.

### When to use fee bumps

- The inner transaction's source account has near-zero XLM.
- You want to sponsor fees for users as part of your application UX.
- Resubmitting a stuck transaction with a higher fee without re-signing the inner envelope.

### How it works in StellarForge

Two utilities are exported from `frontend/src/services/stellar.ts`:

```ts
// 1. Wrap a signed inner transaction in a fee bump envelope.
//    The fee-source account (connected via Freighter) signs the bump.
const signedFeeBumpXdr = await buildFeeBumpTransaction(
  innerTxXdr,
  feeSourceAddress,
);

// 2. Submit the fee bump and wait for confirmation.
const txHash = await submitFeeBumpTransaction(signedFeeBumpXdr);
```

The fee source must have enough XLM to cover the base fee. The inner transaction is not re-signed — only the fee bump envelope requires the fee source's signature.

## Contract Upgrade Process

The factory contract supports in-place WASM upgrades without redeploying or migrating state.

### Schema versioning

`FactoryState` carries a `schema_version: u32` field. The constant `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `lib.rs` is the source of truth. `initialize` stamps the current version on every fresh deployment. `migrate` reads the on-chain version from a standalone `"sv"` storage key and applies each pending upgrade step in order, making it safe to call multiple times (idempotent).

| Version | Change                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Initial versioned schema — added `schema_version` field to `FactoryState` |

### Adding a new migration (version N → N+1)

1. Increment `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `lib.rs` to `N+1`.
2. Add an `if on_chain_version < N+1 { … }` block inside `migrate` that reads the current state, sets new fields to their defaults, writes the updated state, and bumps `on_chain_version`.
3. Add a test in `test.rs` that seeds `sv = N` and asserts the state is correct after calling `migrate`.

### How it works

1. Build and optimize the new contract WASM.
2. Upload the new WASM to the network to obtain its hash:
   ```bash
   stellar contract upload \
     --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/token_factory.optimized.wasm \
     --source <admin-secret-key> \
     --network testnet
   # Outputs: <new-wasm-hash>
   ```
3. Call `upgrade` on the deployed contract:
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <contract-id> \
     --source <admin-secret-key> \
     --network testnet \
     -- upgrade \
     --admin <admin-address> \
     --new_wasm_hash <new-wasm-hash>
   ```
4. If the new version requires data layout changes, call `migrate` immediately after:
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke \
     --id <contract-id> \
     --source <admin-secret-key> \
     --network testnet \
     -- migrate \
     --admin <admin-address>
   ```

Only the admin address can call `upgrade` and `migrate`. Non-admin callers receive `Error::Unauthorized`. Contract state (tokens, fees, admin) is fully preserved across upgrades.
